"""Label the split review questions with the local Ollama model as a teacher.

For every case in data/savic-review/all_cases.json that has an excerpt, asks the
local model the four split questions SAMPLES times at temperature 0.7 and
records the share of "yes" answers as a soft label. Stays on this machine
(Ollama at 127.0.0.1). Resumable: cases already in teacher.jsonl are skipped.

Answer each with true or false:

- about_prospect: the statement is about the prospect company itself, not another company, vendor or customer
- relevant: it says something about the prospect's operations, systems, finances, growth, risks or change that an ERP or modernization pitch could use (not product marketing, legal boilerplate, careers or biography)
- current: true if still true today, or a dated milestone in the company's ownership, acquisition, divestiture or legal-entity history (these shape the ERP landscape at any age); false if a past or superseded one-off: a launch, campaign, sponsorship, job posting, plan, forecast, expected synergy, deal rumour, or risk boilerplate from an old filing.
